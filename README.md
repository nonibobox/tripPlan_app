# Ionic Angular Conference Application

This application is purely a kitchen-sink demo of the Ionic Framework and Angular.

**There is not an actual Ionic Conference at this time.** This project is just to show off Ionic components in a real-world application. 


## Getting Started

* [Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/) for Node.js 6 or greater.
* Install the ionic CLI globally: `npm install -g ionic`
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app.git`.
* Run `npm install` from the project root.
* Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.
* Profit. :tada:
